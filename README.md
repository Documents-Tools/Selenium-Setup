## Environment components:

### Installation (Linux):

**Phing** (a build tool based on â€‹Apache Ant)

**Go to the project root**, [download the phar](http://www.phing.info/get/phing-latest.phar), rename to `phing` and make it an executable.

```
wget http://www.phing.info/get/phing-latest.phar -O; mv phing-latest.phar phing; chmod +x phing
```

Run `phing` to do an environment check and start downloading and unpacking.

After phing has finished, run 'java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.47.0.jar' in a different terminal to start the server, then run `php phpunit.phar` in the current terminal.
